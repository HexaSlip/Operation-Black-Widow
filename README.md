# Operation Black Widow üï∑Ô∏è

Operation Black Widow is my personal honeypot project, designed to simulate a real administrative control panel to bait and log unauthorized access attempts. As an aspiring red teamer, I'm using this project to explore:
- deception techniques
- attacker fingerprinting
- local logging and monitoring in Linux

‚ö†Ô∏è This honeypot is designed to run **only within a local environment** for ethical and educational purposes.

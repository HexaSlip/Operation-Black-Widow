## Operation Black Widow üï∑Ô∏è 
## Tagline:
- A Web Application Honeypot for Attacker Behavioral Analysis
## Project Summary: 
This project is a personal web application honeypot designed to simulate an administrative control panel to bait and log unauthorized access attempts. As an aspiring Red Teamer, this project was developed to gain practical, hands-on experience in deception technology and local threat monitoring.
## Key Features: 
- Deception Technique: Deployed a fake administrative panel to lure and deceive attackers.
- Threat Intelligence: Gained insight into attacker methodology by logging and analyzing their attempted actions.
- Incident Logging: Capture critical data points, including timestamps, IP addresses, and the data.
- Credential Theft Simulation: Captured and logged attempted usernames and passwords to understand credential-based attacks. 
- File Upload Analysis: Monitored and logged malicious file upload attempts, a common vector for remote code execution. 

## Key Learnings and Skills Demonstrated:
- Threat Intelligence and Analysis
- Honeypot Deployment
- Web Application Security
- Python3 & Bash Scripting
- Incident Logging & Management 
- File Upload Vulnerability Analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This honeypot is designed to run **only within a local environment** for ethical and educational purposes. Do not deploy on a public-facing network. 

## Technologies Used: 
- Python3
- Base
